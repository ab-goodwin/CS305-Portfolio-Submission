- **Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

*Artemis Financial is a financial institution that wants to incorporate additional security into their existing application.*

- **What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?**

*I believe I did well generating checksum values using various encryption algorithms for data validation. Ensuring data security is crucial for both customers and companies, especially in an age of digital attacks and piracy. Secure coding should be the top priority in every step of the Software Development Life Cycle.*

- **What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?**

*The maven dependency check tool was the most helpful, it created a shortcut in detecting vulnerabilities compared to checking each dependency by hand*
  
- **How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?**

*Most of the vulnerabilities were caused by using old libraries. By updating the libraries currently being used, the software becomes stronger and more secure. We can use penetration testing in the future will better assess the and additional vulnerabilities within the code.*
  
- **How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

*I repeatedly ran debugs to ensure that it was functional. After changing the code, I ran another vulnerability test to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.*
  
- **What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

*I used stack overflow to find fixes for different errors I would recieve while coding, and see how other users solved similar issues.*
  
- **Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?**
*I feel the most comfortable using the dependency check tool, and developing the vulnerability list, as well as using has functions to encrypt input values.*
